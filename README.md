Create auto updating bookmarks on navigation in the same domain, for example to
read webcomics and continue from where you left off This add-on can create
auto-bookmarks (aka. a bookmark which updates itself to always point to the last
location on the same domain you visited with it as its startpoint. This allows
to catch up to webcomics and other sites without losing track of where you left
off, wenn you exit the site. Tested with - https://xkcd.com/1/ and many others
from - http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/

<b>Usage:</b>
<ol>
  <li>Visit the site you want to track</li>
  <li>Click the toolbar button</li>
  <li>
    This will create a bookmark, which which wen visited updates on navigation
  </li>
  <li>
    Closing the tab or navigating to a different origin/domain will stop the
    bookmark updates. By re-opening the bookmark again, tracking will resume
  </li>
  <li>
    To change the default save location you can right click on any real bookmark
    folder (sadly this does not include the "Bookmarks Toolbar" and "Bookmarks
    Menu" entries, but everything else is fair game) and just check the Context
    menu entry "Save AUB here"
  </li>
</ol>
