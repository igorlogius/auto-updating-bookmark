Auto updating bookmark on navigation in the same domain, for example to read webcomics and continue from where you left off

This add-on can create auto-bookmarks (aka. a bookmark which updates itself to always point to the last location on the same domain you visited with it as its startpoint.

This allows to catch up to webcomics and other sites without losing track of where you left off, wenn you exit the site.

Tested with
- https://xkcd.com/1/
and many others from

<b>Usage:</b>
<ol>
    <li>
    Visit the site you want to track
    </li><li>
    Click the toolbar button
    </li><li>
    This will create a bookmark, which which wen visited updates on navigation
    </li><li>
    Closing the tab or navigating to a different origin/domain will stop the bookmark updates. By re-opening the bookmark again, tracking will resume
    </li><li>
    To change the default save location you can right click on any real bookmark folder (sadly this does not include the "Bookmarks Toolbar" and "Bookmarks Menu" entries, but everything else is fair game) and just check the Context menu entry "Check to save DAU bookmarks here"
    </li>
</ol>
